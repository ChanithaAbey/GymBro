The system currently focuses on bicep curls, where it uses pose estimation to track joint positions, evaluate movement patterns, and classify repetitions as correct or incorrect form. The system is also optimised for Google Colab to simplify setup and execution, while remaining fully compatible with local Python environments.\n","\n","It detects common issues such as elbow drift, incomplete range of motion, and poor movement control, while also identifying properly executed repetitions. The architecture is exercise-agnostic, allowing the same pipeline to be extended to other exercises by defining new movement rules or integrating learned classifiers.\n","\n","**Highlights**\n","- Environment-aware execution (Google Colab–optimised with local fallback)\n","- Reproducible pipeline using deterministic seeding and stratified data splits\n","- Primary subject tracking to ignore background bystanders\n","- Automated per-clip quality assurance and sanity checks\n","- Label-free, rule-driven exercise form classification with feedback generation\n","- Idempotent output handling for safe and stable re-runs\n","\n","**Tech Stack**\n","- Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe Pose, YOLOv8, XGBoost, scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, joblib, Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"df31c1e5","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"df31c1e5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1769764987577,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":26107,"user":{"displayName":"Chanitha Abeygunawardena","userId":"04777994892816556693"}},"outputId":"f3765f81-f05c-483e-8855-b406ea1436c9"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[info] Mounting Google Drive...\n","Mounted at /content/drive\n","[ok] Dependencies ready.\n"]}],"source":["# %% Environment detection\n","\n","import os\n","import sys\n","import subprocess\n","\n","# Detect Colab\n","try:\n","    import google.colab\n","    IN_COLAB = True\n","except ImportError:\n","    IN_COLAB = False\n","\n","DRIVE_MOUNTED = False\n","\n","if IN_COLAB:\n","    from google.colab import drive\n","\n","    # Mount Drive only if not already mounted\n","    if not os.path.exists(\"/content/drive/MyDrive\"):\n","        print(\"[info] Mounting Google Drive...\")\n","        drive.mount(\"/content/drive\")\n","    else:\n","        print(\"[ok] Google Drive already mounted.\")\n","\n","    DRIVE_MOUNTED = os.path.exists(\"/content/drive/MyDrive\")\n","\n","    if not DRIVE_MOUNTED:\n","        raise RuntimeError(\"Google Drive mount failed.
